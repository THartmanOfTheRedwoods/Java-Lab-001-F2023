3. In common English, what does the word compile mean? **To gather info from multiple sources into one place**
4. What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun? **An executable is object code that is ready to run on specific hardware. It's used as a noun rather than an adjective because it's describing the name of the file rather than the nature of it**
