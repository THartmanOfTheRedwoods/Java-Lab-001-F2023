Question 1. In computer jargon, whatâ€™s the difference between a statement and a comment?
A statement is telling you what the code needs to do, and a comment tells us what it will do.

Question 2. What does it mean to say that a program is portable?
It means that the program is easy to move from one place to another, like moving it to other coding software.

Question 3. In common English, what does the word compile mean?

The word compile means to put everything into one big pile, or to put together.

Question 4. What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?

An executable is something that causes a computer to do a given task for the coded instructions. It is a noun because it is a thing, which falls under the definition of noun, person, place, or thing.
