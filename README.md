# Exercise 1.1 Questions
**1. In computer jargon, whatâ€™s the difference between a statement and a comment?**
<br><br> A statement specifies one step of an algorithm, thus it effects the way the program runs. Conversely, a comment has no effect on the way a program runs, but simply contains helpful information about the program.<br><br>
**2. What does it mean to say that a program is portable?**
<br><br> A portable program needs few or no modifications to run on different computer types. <br><br>
**3. In common English, what does the word compile mean?**
<br><br> To compile a program means to translate the entire program from a high-level language to a low-level language. This converts a program into an executable format. <br><br>
**4. What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?**
<br><br> An executable is a program that has been translated by a compiler and is ready to be repeatedly executed without need of further translation. It is a noun because it refers to a specific segment of code that is ready to be executed.
